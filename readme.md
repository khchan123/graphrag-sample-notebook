# Using knowledge graphs to build GraphRAG applications with Amazon Bedrock and Amazon Neptune

In this project, we will run a GraphRAG sample using Amazon Bedrock and Amazon Neptune. More details can be found on [AWS blog post](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/using-knowledge-graphs-to-build-graphrag-applications-with-amazon-bedrock-and-amazon-neptune/).

## Instructions
 - You may run this notebook on [Neptune graph notebooks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/neptune/latest/userguide/graph-notebooks.html) for easier setup.

 - [01-Build-Identity-Graph.ipynb](./01-Build-Identity-Graph.ipynb) is for graph setup. Run this with `Python3` kernel came from graph notebook.
 - [02-GraphRAG.ipynb](./02-GraphRAG.ipynb) is for running GraphRAG. Run this with `conda_python3` kernel.
